    "# Hardware lab 1: implementing your control law / Steer by wire\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first hardware lab we are first going to work without the passive arms of our robot and only focus on the motors. You have 2 objectives for the lab: The first one is to tune your PD gains to implement an accurate torque control on the motors. The second one is to reproduce a [steer-by-wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steer-by-wire) system. This should allow you to become familiar with the API of the motors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "First, listen to Garry or Katy for the first few minutes of the lab while they provide some guidance on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating with the device\n",
    "The DICE machines are connected to the platform using a CAN device. This is hidden within a high-level API but you can have a look at the code if you are interested in seeing how all of this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API is presented in [AROMotorControlAPI.md](https://github.com/ediaro23/hardwarelab/blob/main/AROMotorControlAPI.md). The only methods that we need are `readPosition` and `applyCurrentToMotor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has a `motorid` parameter, taking the value 1 or 2, which points to the motor that you wish to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to read the position (joint angle value) or a motor, simply call:\n",

    "\n",

    "You will have observed that the API only proposes a method to send a current command, while we expect to control or robots in torque. The torque is proportional to the current through the relationship $\\tau = k I $, with $\\tau$ the torque, $I$ the current (in Amperes), and k a constant given by the manufacturer. In our case, the torque constant provided by the [manufacturer](https://www.myactuator.com/product-page/rmd-l-5010) is $0.16$, which trivially gives you $I = \\frac{\\tau}{0.16}$. We will trust the manufacturer although this might change from a motor to the other (and is yet another source of approximation).\n",

    "## Question 1\n",
    "Write a function that performs one iteration of a control loop: Given a desired position and a motor, read the current state and perform one step of PD control to bring the motor to the desired state. \n",
    "<mark>Important:</mark> Please make sure that you execute this or any other function in a try-catch block (as shown in [template.py](./template.py)) so that if for any reason you have to terminate your program, the motors stop. Otherwise the motors will continue to execute the last command applied to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Test this function within a loop and plot the obtained trajectory. Tune your P and D gains accordingly until you reach a desired behaviour. We are going to control the system at a frequency of 1 khz, which means that each tick should last 1 ms. As for the rununtil function in the lab, the control loop should have a structure like this one:\n",

    "Now, write a 30s control loop that does the following:\n",

    "+ Motor 2 is configured to track the position of motor 1\n",
